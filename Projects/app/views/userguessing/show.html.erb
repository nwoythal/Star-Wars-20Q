        <br>
        <br>There are two game styles to choose from.
        <br>
        <br>1. Guess yours
        <br>
        <br>  Once you select this mode, the computer will begin to ask you a series of close-ended (yes/no) questions. The computer will ask
        <br>  you up to 20 questions to try to figure out the what the player has chosen. Once it gets to the twentieth question, or what it thinks is
        <br>  the answer,  the computer will guess what your answer is. If the player indicates that the computer has guessed correctly  a “Win" will
        <br>  be displayed on the screen. If it loses, there will be a “Lose” on the screen.
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>2. Guess mine
        <br>
        <br>  Once you select this mode, you will be prompted to ask the computer a yes/no question of your have choice. You can ask up
        <br>  to 20 close-ended (yes/no) questions, so when you have asked the 20th question and have not yet answered, you will have to guess.
        <br>  Although you will be able to guess at any point throughout the game, via the guess button in the corner. Users may guess only one
        <br>  time. If you guess correctly, the word “Win” will be displayed on the screen. If you guess incorrectly, you will receive a “Lose.”
