        <br>
        <br>Once you choose this mode, you will be directed to the page with a choice of categories. You get to choose either a category as the theme.
        <br>Once you have selected your choice, the computer will begin to ask you a series of close-ended (yes/no) questions. The computer will ask
        <br>you up to 20 questions to try to figure out the what the player has chosen. Once it gets to the twentieth question, or what it thinks is
        <br>the answer,  the computer will guess what your answer is. If the player indicates that the computer has guessed correctly  a “Win" will
        <br>be displayed on the screen. If it loses, there will be a “Lose” on the screen.

        <br>When you Guess
        <br>
        <br>Once you choose this mode, you will be directed to the page with a choice of categories. You get to choose a category as the theme.
        <br>Once you have selected your choice, you will be prompted to ask a question regarding the category you have chosen. You can ask up
        <br>to 20 close-ended (yes/no) questions, so when you have asked the 20th question and have not yet answered, you will have to guess.
        <br>Although you will be able to guess at any point throughout the game, via the guess button in the corner. Users may guess only one
        <br>time. If you guess correctly, the word “Win” will be displayed on the screen. If you guess incorrectly, you will receive a “Lose.”
