# Star Wars 20 Questions
This is an assignment in learning about Software as a Service, the agile development life cycle, and automated testing (in both BDD and TDD). Check the gemfile for dependencies.

Rules:
There are two game styles to choose from.  

1. Guess yours  
Once you select this mode, the computer will begin to ask you a series of close-ended (yes/no) questions. The computer will ask you up to 20 questions to try to figure out the what the player has chosen. Once it gets to the twentieth question, or what it thinks is the answer,  the computer will guess what your answer is. If the player indicates that the computer has guessed correctly  a “Win" will be displayed on the screen. If it loses, there will be a “Lose” on the screen.  

2. Guess mine  
Once you select this mode, you will be prompted to ask the computer a yes/no question of your have choice. You can ask up to 20 close-ended (yes/no) questions, so when you have asked the 20th question and have not yet answered, you will have to guess. Although you will be able to guess at any point throughout the game, via the guess button in the corner. Users may guess only one time. If you guess correctly, the word “Win” will be displayed on the screen. If you guess incorrectly, you will receive a “Lose.”

What could be added in future iterations:  
Language Processing: As of right now, questions have to be exact for the guess mine game.
More tests: We got to above 95% coverage, which is phenomenal, but that is not indicative of a bug-free project.
